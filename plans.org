#+TITLE: Plans


* Near future
** TODO add go down on space for the library and playlist
requires changing all the functions from =EventM Name (Next HState)= to
 =EventM Name HState= and having the =continue= explicit in the keybindigns, which
 is probably a better idea anyway.
** TODO hackage?
** TODO impliment search history
** TODO playlist editing
** TODO Various Artists

* Medium Future
** TODO display random song order
** TODO more vim motions
** TODO tags

* Far future
** TODO write generic Response handler to print the MPDError instead of doing the thing.
** TODO (oneday) album art stuff, look into hip and jucypixels on hackage
